### Domain-Driven Design sample

This project is a sample of .NET implementation of a medical prescription model using the approach "Domain-Driven Design" (DDD) and the architectural pattern "Command and Query Responsibility Segregation" (CQRS).

**Points of interest**

The goal of the project is to test and provide some .NET implementations of core concepts of DDD (entities, value objects, domain events, ...) and CQRS (commands, queries, command and query handlers, ...) on the basis of a concrete model.

Only a lightweight version of CQRS (no data projection, one data store) has been considered.
